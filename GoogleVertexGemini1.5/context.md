This program attempts to optimize for speed, but achieving optimal performance for a file of this size requires careful benchmarking and tuning on the specific hardware.  AOT compilation (using tools like GraalVM Native Image) would offer significant performance gains, but is beyond the scope of a simple code example.  SIMD instructions are highly architecture-dependent and require careful vectorization,  which would significantly increase code complexity.  GC tuning is also very hardware-specific and requires profiling.  Therefore, the code below focuses on efficient data structures and parallel processing with streams.

To compile and run:

1. Save the code as `WeatherProcessor.java`.
2. Compile: `javac alex/WeatherProcessor.java`
3. Run: `java alex.WeatherProcessor your_input_file.txt`  (Replace `your_input_file.txt` with the actual path).


Remember to create a large text file (`your_input_file.txt`) with the specified format for testing.  The performance will heavily depend on the hardware and the size of the input file.  Further optimization might involve using more advanced techniques like custom memory mapped I/O for file reading (which would require additional libraries).  This example prioritizes simplicity and readability while still leveraging Java's parallel processing capabilities.
