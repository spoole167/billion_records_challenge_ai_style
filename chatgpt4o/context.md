Here's a Java program designed to process the described file with high performance using modern Java features.
It uses multithreading, efficient I/O operations, and modern Java Streams to achieve speed.

Key Features


Threading: Utilizes a custom ForkJoinPool for parallel processing of the file, maximizing CPU utilization.

Concurrency: Uses a thread-safe ConcurrentHashMap and atomic variables for shared state without locks.

Modern Java: Takes advantage of Stream.parallel(), Files.newBufferedReader, and DoubleAdder/LongAdder for high performance.

Input Handling: Handles comments, malformed lines, and invalid temperature data gracefully.

Usage

Compile the program:

javac WeatherStationProcessor.java

Run the program:

java useroptimized.WeatherStationProcessor <input_file>

Assumptions

The input file fits within the constraints of available disk and memory I/O.

Java 20 or later is installed to support modern features and optimal GC performance.
