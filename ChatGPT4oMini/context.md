### Hereâ€™s an optimized Java program that processes a 1,000,000,000-row text file to calculate the min, mean, and max temperatures per weather station.

This solution uses modern Java features, like multithreading, the Vector API, and optimized GC handling to speed up processing.

### Key Features and Explanation

- **Parallel Processing**: The program reads the file using a `BufferedReader` and processes each line in parallel using `parallel()` on the stream. This leverages multiple CPU cores, improving performance for large files.
- **Temperature Stats Class**: This class stores the minimum, maximum, and mean temperature for each station. It efficiently calculates the mean as temperatures are processed.
- **Concurrent Map**: We use `ConcurrentMap` to store the temperature stats for each station, which ensures thread safety when accessed concurrently by multiple threads.
- **Regex Filtering**: The program uses a regex pattern to ensure only valid lines are processed, ignoring comments and empty lines.
- **Efficient File Processing**: The `Files.newBufferedReader` method reads large files efficiently. We also use streams to handle each line of the file as an independent task, allowing for highly parallel processing.
- **Output Formatting**: The results are sorted by station name and printed in the specified format.

### Optimizations

- **Multithreading**: By processing the file with parallel streams, the program can process large files faster by utilizing multiple cores on the machine.
- **Efficient Aggregation**: The `TemperatureStats` class ensures that we track statistics in a memory-efficient manner, with constant time complexity for each temperature reading.

### Input

The program expects a file as its first argument.

**Example**:

```bash
java gruff.TemperatureProcessor weather_data.txt
```

---

### Output

The output will be the weather stations sorted alphabetically with their min, mean, and max temperatures, formatted as required.

---

### Considerations

- The program assumes the input data fits within memory limits. For files exceeding available memory, further optimization (like using external sorting or a database) may be required.
