Can you explain how the parallel processing works in this code?

Sure. In the provided code, parallel processing is achieved using the `parallel()` method on the stream of lines read from the file. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Reading the File**: The file is read using a `BufferedReader` wrapped around a `FileReader`. This allows efficient reading of the file line by line.

2. **Creating a Stream**: The `lines()` method of `BufferedReader` creates a stream of lines from the file.

3. **Parallel Processing**: The `parallel()` method is called on the stream, which converts the sequential stream into a parallel stream. This means that the subsequent operations on the stream can be executed in parallel by multiple threads.

4. **Filtering and Processing Lines**: Each line is processed in parallel:
    - Lines starting with `#` are ignored.
    - Each valid line is split into the station name and temperature.
    - The temperature is parsed as a `double`.
    - The `computeIfAbsent` method of `ConcurrentHashMap` is used to get or create a `StationStats` object for the station.
    - The `addTemperature` method of `StationStats` is called to update the statistics for the station.

5. **Thread-Safe Updates**: The `ConcurrentHashMap` and `StationStats` classes ensure thread-safe updates:
    - `ConcurrentHashMap` allows concurrent access and updates to the map.
    - `StationStats` uses `DoubleAdder` and `LongAdder` for thread-safe accumulation of sum and count, and synchronized methods for updating min and max temperatures.

This approach leverages multiple CPU cores to process the file faster, especially useful for large files.

Here is the relevant part of the code for reference:

```java
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(inputFile))) {
    reader.lines().parallel().forEach(line -> {
        if (!line.startsWith("#")) {
            String[] parts = line.split(";");
            if (parts.length == 2) {
                String station = parts[0];
                double temperature = Double.parseDouble(parts[1]);
                stationStatsMap.computeIfAbsent(station, k -> new StationStats()).addTemperature(temperature);
            }
        }
    });
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

This code efficiently processes each line of the file in parallel, updating the statistics for each weather station concurrently.
