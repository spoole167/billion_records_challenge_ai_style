# Billion Records Challenge - AI Style

**All the Java code in this project was generated by an AI using this prompt**

--- 
Write a Java program to process a 1,000,000,000-row text file, calculate the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station, and print results alphabetically as: 
{Abha=5.0/18.0/27.4, Abidjan=15.7/26.0/34.1, ...}

File Format:
Each row has Station;Temperature (e.g., Hamburg;12.0). Lines starting with # are comments and should be ignored.

Rules:

Use Java only; no external dependencies.
Include Java version in a comment.
Input file name is the first command-line argument.
Include all necessary imports, Javadoc, and comments.
Package name must be one word, based on your name.

Goal:
Optimize for speed using modern Java features (e.g., threads, Vector API, SIMD, GC tuning, AOT)._
