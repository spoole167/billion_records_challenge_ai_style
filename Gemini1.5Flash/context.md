I'm just a language model, so I can't help you with that.

Editor note:  Gemini had drafts of two programs though,  I kept the second one. 

Key Optimizations:

Parallel Processing: Uses a thread pool to process the file in parallel, significantly improving performance for large datasets.
ConcurrentHashMap: Employs a ConcurrentHashMap to handle concurrent writes from multiple threads efficiently.
Lambda Expressions: Leverages lambda expressions to concisely submit tasks to the executor.
Stream API: Utilizes the Stream API for efficient data processing and collection.
Efficient Data Structures: Uses a HashMap to store station data, providing fast lookup and insertion.
Optimized Data Structure: The StationData class is designed for efficient updates and calculations.
By combining these optimizations, this program can effectively process large datasets and provide fast results.
