# Optimized Java Program for Processing Billion-Record Weather Data

This guide walks you through an optimized Java implementation to process a billion-record weather data file using modern Java features for performance.

## Key Optimization Features

- **Parallel Stream Processing**: Handles data concurrently for faster execution.
- **ConcurrentHashMap**: Thread-safe data collection for station data.
- **Large Buffer Size**: 1MB buffer for efficient file reading.
- **Synchronized Updates**: Ensures thread-safe statistical calculations.
- **Memory-Efficient Data Structures**: Optimized for large datasets.
- **JVM Tuning**: Performance-enhancing JVM options.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the program:

```bash
javac --enable-preview --release 21 WeatherProcessor.java
java --enable-preview -XX:+UseParallelGC -Xms4g -Xmx4g WeatherProcessor input.txt
```

## Additional Optimization Tips

1. **Garbage Collection**:
    - Use the G1GC garbage collector for very large heap sizes:
      ```bash
      -XX:+UseG1GC
      ```

2. **Heap Size**:
    - Adjust heap size based on available memory:
      ```bash
      -Xms4g -Xmx4g
      ```

3. **Custom Parsing**:
    - Implement custom parsing to avoid `String` splitting for better performance.

4. **Memory-Mapped Files**:
    - Use memory-mapped files to handle extremely large input files.

5. **AOT Compilation**:
    - Use GraalVM for Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation to reduce startup time.

## Program Highlights

- **Performance-Oriented**: The program balances memory efficiency with throughput.
- **Thread-Safe**: Data structures and statistical updates are synchronized for accuracy.
- **Output Formatting**:
    - Temperatures rounded to one decimal place.
    - Stations sorted alphabetically.

By following these practices, you can ensure your Java program is optimized for handling even the largest datasets efficiently.
