Certainly! Hereâ€™s a Java program that processes a text file containing weather station data, calculates the minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures per weather station, and prints the results alphabetically.

This program leverages parallel processing to read and process the large file efficiently. It uses ConcurrentHashMap to safely update statistics from multiple threads. The DoubleAdder and AtomicInteger classes help manage concurrent updates to the sum and count of temperatures, respectively.

This code aims to be efficient and fast, utilizing modern Java features like streams and parallel processing for optimization. If you have further requirements or need additional functionality, feel free to ask!
