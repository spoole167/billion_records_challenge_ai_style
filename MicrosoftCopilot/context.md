### Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Leverages parallel streams to efficiently read and process large files.
- **Thread-Safe Updates**: Uses `ConcurrentHashMap` to safely update statistics from multiple threads.
- **Efficient Aggregation**: Utilizes `DoubleAdder` and `AtomicInteger` to manage concurrent updates to the sum and count of temperatures, respectively.
- **Modern Java Features**: Employs streams and parallel processing for high performance and scalability.
